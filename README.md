Vanguard A/B Testing - Project 2: EDA and Inferential Stats

Introduction

This project involves an analysis of an A/B test conducted by Vanguard, a US-based investment management company. The A/B test aimed to determine if a redesigned User Interface (UI) with in-context prompts would enhance the online process for clients, leading to higher completion rates. Our task is to analyze the experiment results using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Performance Metrics, and Hypothesis Testing.

Project Overview

	•	Project Title: Vanguard A/B Testing - EDA and Inferential Stats
	•	Team Members: [Add your names here]
	•	Company: Vanguard, USA
	•	Experiment Dates: March 15, 2017 – June 20, 2017
	•	Objective: Evaluate whether a new digital interface leads to improved process completion rates.

Datasets Used

	1.	Client Profiles (df_final_demo): Contains client demographics and account details.
	2.	Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data pt_1 & pt_2): Logs client interactions online. The two parts of this dataset were merged for comprehensive analysis.
	3.	Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients): Specifies clients who participated in the experiment and their group (control/test).

Project Structure

	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Analyzing the distribution of client demographics and behaviors.
	•	Identifying key client segments (age, tenure, etc.) involved in the online process.
	•	Merging and cleaning datasets to prepare for analysis.
	•	Performance Metrics:
	•	Evaluating key performance indicators (KPIs) such as completion rates for the control and test groups.
	•	Hypothesis Testing:
	•	Testing whether the new UI leads to significantly higher completion rates.
	•	Additional hypothesis tests related to cost-effectiveness and client behavior.
	•	Experiment Evaluation:
	•	Assessing the effectiveness of the experiment design, duration, and any data gaps.

Tools and Technologies

	•	Python: Used for data cleaning, EDA, and statistical analysis.
	•	Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: Libraries used for data manipulation and visualization.
	•	Tableau: Used for creating interactive visualizations.
	•	GitHub: Project version control and collaboration.
	•	Jupyter Notebooks: Main development environment for data analysis.
	•	Kanban Board (Trello): Project management and task tracking.

Key Deliverables

	1.	Jupyter Notebooks: Containing all data exploration, cleaning, and hypothesis testing code.
	2.	Python Scripts (.py): Functions used in the analysis are modularized into .py files.
	3.	Tableau Visualizations: Interactive dashboards for data insights.
	4.	Project Presentation: Google Slides with final project outcomes and conclusions.
	5.	GitHub Repository: [Link to the repository here]
	6.	Kanban Board: [Link to the Trello board here]

Results and Findings

	•	Key Insights: Initial analysis of client behavior and demographics.
	•	Completion Rate: Comparison between control and test groups for completion rates.
	•	Hypothesis Testing Results: Statistically significant findings on the effectiveness of the new UI.

Conclusion

This project provides insights into whether the UI redesign had a positive impact on the completion rates of Vanguard clients. The findings will help guide further decisions on digital design improvements.
